$ git checkout <branch-name>

The git checkout command lets you navigate between the branches created by git branch .

git checkout -b ＜new-branch＞

The above example simultaneously creates and checks out ＜new-branch＞. 
The -b option is a convenience flag that tells Git 
to run "git branch" before running "git checkout ＜new-branch＞".
